The dataset includes 6436 images.
Card are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -18 and +18 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.49 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random shear of between -6째 to +6째 horizontally and -6째 to +6째 vertically
